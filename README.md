# N-body-Simulation
A celestial universe, done with the help of the SFML graphics library, VcXsrv, and C++.

Each individual planet is drawn to the screen with SFML and VcXsrv, which the positions of
each planet updated constantly to achieve the result of the planets orbiting.

## Tools
- SFML
- VcXsrv
- C++

## Installation (WSL)
1. Install SFML with `sudo apt-get install libsfml-dev` for the SFML dependencies.
2. Install VcXsrv via https://sourceforge.net/projects/vcxsrv/ (not necessary for MacOS or any other unix system)
3. Follow the rest of this tutorial to display a test sprite. https://www.sfml-dev.org/tutorials/2.5/start-linux.php
